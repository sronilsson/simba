The SimBA region of intrest (ROI) interface allows users to define and draw ROIs on videos. The ROI data can be used to visualize and calculate basic descriptive statistics based on animals movements and locations. The ROI data can also be used to build potentially valuable additional features for random forest predictive classifiers; if the which to generate a machine model that classify behaviors that depend on spatial location (e.g., eating/drinking/freezing/rearing/attack/mating at a specific location in the environment), then ROI data is crucial. **CAUTION**: If such ROI based features are irrelevant for the behaviour beying classified, then they should not be calculated and they should not be included in the machine model generation.  

# Before analyzing ROIs in SimBA

In SimBA, there are two possible ways of analyzing ROI data. The **first** route is designed for scenarios when you are *only* intrested in analyzing and/or visualizing the number of entries and time spent within the different ROIs, and you *will not* use the ROI data to create features for building random forest classifiers. This first route requires the data needs to be processed through up-to and including the the steps described in [Part 2 - Step 4 - Correcting outliers](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md#step-4-outlier-correction). The **second** route is designed for scenarious when you are intrested in using the ROI data to create features, as well as intrested in analyzing and/or visualizing the number of entries and time spent within the different ROIs. This second route requires the data needs to be processed through up to and including [Part 2 - Step 5](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md#step-4-outlier-correction) outlined in [Scenario1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md). This the second route requires the user to [Extract features] before analyzing ROI data, while the first route does *not* require this step.   

Specifically, for both routes, begin by (i) [Importing your videos to the project](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md#step-2-import-videos-into-project-folder), (ii) [Importing the tracking data to your project](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md#step-3-import-dlc-tracking-data), (iii) [Set the video parameters](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md#step-3-set-video-parameters), and (iv) [Correct outliers](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Scenario1.md#step-4-outlier-correction). If you are intrested in using the ROi data as features, also go ahead and (v) [Extract features](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-5-extract-features).  

In this tutorial we will describe the 2nd route. However, the first route is identical - the difference is aonly that you should use the menu in the **Correct outliers** tab, rather than the **ROI tab** of the `Load project` menu. 

>**A short explanation on what is meant by "using ROI data as features for random forest classifiers"** When the user specifies different ROIs in SimBA, then we can calculate several metrics that goes beyond the coordinates of the different body-parts extracted from pose-estimation. For example - for each frame of the video - we can now calculate the distance between the body-parts and the ROIs, if the animal is inside or outside the ROIs, and if the animal is directing towards the ROIs. These measures can also be used to calculate several further features such as the percentage of the session, up to and including the any frame, the animal has spent within a specific ROI. These and other ROI-based features could be useful for classifying behaviors in certain scenarious.

# Part 1. Defining ROIs in SimBA

1. In the main SimBA console window, begin by loading you project by clicking on `File` and `Load project`. In the **[Load Project]** tab, click on `Browse File` and select the `project_config.ini` file belonging to your project. 

2. Navigate to the **ROI** tab, which should look like this:

![](/images/roi_main.PNG)

3. Begin at the left hand side of the **ROI** tab, in the sub-menu **Define ROI**. This menu lets you define **the number of rectangles, circles, and polygons** you which to draw on the videos in the project. 

>*Note:* All videos in the project needs to contain the same number of shapes. For example, if you wish to analyze four ROIs in the first video of your peoject, but only three ROIs in the second video of your project, then you still need to draw four ROIs for both the first and second video in your peoject. 

In the three entry boxes associated with each shape, enter the number of each shape you wish to draw. If you do *not* want to draw a specific shape, leave the entry box blank or enter the integer number 0. 

4. Once you've enetered the number of shapes, then click on the `Show Shape Definitions Table` button and the following table will pop up.

![](/images/roidef1.PNG)

In this table, enter a name for each of your shapes in the Rectangle Name, Circle Name, and Polygon Name entry boxes. Make sure the names of each of the shapes are different from each other - e.g., here cannot be two circle shapes both named `Circle`. Once all the names have been entered, click on the `Set Shape Definitions` button which is located at the bottom of the `Shape Definitions Table`

5. After clicking on the `Set Shape Definitions` button, the following table will pop up.

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_menu.JPG)

The table will contain one row for each of the videos in the project. Each video in the project has three buttons associated with it: **Draw, Reset,** and **Apply to all**. The functions associated with each button is described in detail below. However, in brief, the **Draw** button allows you to start to draw the defined shapes on the specific video. If drawings already exist for the video, then the **Draw** buttons opens an interface where you to move the shapes that has previously been drawn. The **Reset** button deletes any drawing made on the specific video and allows you to restart the drawing from scratch by next clicking on the **Draw** button. The **Apply to all** buttons copies the drawing made on the specific video and replicates it on all other videos in the project. If a drawing has been applied to all videos videos in the project by clicking on the **Apply to all** button, then the shapes for any specific video can be moved by clicking on the **Draw** button.

6. To begin draw your shapes, click on the **Draw** button for the first video in the table. Once clicked, a window will first pop up that contains instructions for how to draw your shapes. The instructions for drawing rectangles, circles, and polygons are slightly different. Any user-defined rectangles will be processed first. The instructions for drawing rectangles will look like the image below to the left, and the process of drawing the rectangle should look like the gif image below to the right:

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_rectangle.JPG" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Rectangle_draw.gif" width="425"/>

In this example, to begin to draw the rectangle named "TopLeft" on Video1, press on `Esc`. When `Esc` is pressed, the first frame of Video1 is displayed. Click and hold the left mouse button at the top left corner of rectangle "TopLeft" and drag the mouse to the bottom right corner of the rectangle. If you're unhappy with your rectangle, start to draw the rectangle again by holding the left mouse button at the top left corner of your, new, revised recangle. The previous rectangle will be automatically discarded. When you are happy with your rectangle, press `Esc` twice to save your rectangle and move to your next shape. 

>*Note*: If the image of the first frame of the video look distorted and the aspect ratio is off, then grab the side of the window that contains your frame to correct the aspect ratio. If the first frame of your video contains the experimenter hand, or no animal(s) (because the camera was turned on before the animal(s) was placed in the arena - then go back and [pre-process your videos appropriatly](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial_process_videos.md#tutorial-for-processing-videos-in-batch). 

Once all user-defined rectangles have been drawn, any user-defined circles will be processed. The instructions for drawing circles will look like the image below to the left, and the process of drawing the a circle should look like the gif image below to the right:

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_circles.JPG" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Circle_draw.gif" width="425"/>

In this example, to begin to draw the circle named "Cage" on Video1, press on `Esc`. When `Esc` is pressed, the first frame of Video1 is displayed. If you have drawn any rectangles previously, then these rectangles will also be displayed on the frame. Begin by double left mouse clicking on the image where you would like the center of the circle to be. Next, double left click on the image where you would like the outer bound of the circle to be. If you are unhappy with the center of the circle, then double left mouse click on the center of the circle, and double left mouse click again at the new circle center location. Likewise, if you are unhappy with the outer bounds and the diameter of the circle, then double left mouse click on outer bounds of the circle, and double left click again at the new circle outer bounds location. When you are happy with your circle, press `Esc` to save your circle and move to the next user-defined  shape. 

Once all the circles have been drawn, any user-defined polygons will be processed. The instructions for drawing polygons will look like the image below to the left, and the process of drawing the polygon should look like the gif image below to the right:

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_polygons.JPG" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Polygon_draw.gif" width="425"/>

In this example, to begin to draw the polygon named "Polygon1" on Video1, press on `Esc`. When `Esc` is pressed, the first frame of Video1 is displayed. If you have previously drawn any rectangles or circles, then these rectangles and/or circles will also be displayed on the frame. Click on at least three different locations in the image that defines the outer bounds of "Polygon1". SimBA does currently not allow re-definitions of the bounds locations of the polygon once they have been specified. If you are unhappy with your drawn polygon, you can chose to either (i) move the entire polygon in a later step (see Step 6, just below), or **Reset** the drawings and start again (see Step 6, just below). When you have finished your polygon, press `Esc` to save your polygon and move to the next user-defined shape (or to finish, if all user-defined shapes have been drawn).

6. If you have finished the drawing for Video1, and you are not entirely happy with the drawings, you can either: (i) click on the **Reset** button next to Video1: this will delete the drawings you have made on Video1, and you can now again click on **Draw** button next to Video1 to restart Step 5 descibed above. Alternatively, you can click on **Draw** again, **without** first clicking on the **Reset** button. This allows you to move all the shapes in Video1 that you have previously defined. When you click on **Draw** again **without** first clicking on **Reset**, then the following instruction window will pop open (below left), and moving the shapes should look like this (below right):

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_move.JPG" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Move_shapes.gif" width="425"/>

To start moving the shapes that has previously been  drawn, first click on the centroid belonging to the shape that you wish to move. This will cause the shape to disapear. Next, double left click on the new centroid location of the shape you are moving. This will display the shape in its new location. When you are happy with the locatins of all the shapes, press on `Esc` to save the new shape locations.  

7. Once all the shapes have been drawn on a single video there are two possible routes to getting the shapes drawn on all of the videos in the project. The first alternative, which is likely the more time-consuming option, is to click on each of the **Draw** buttons associated with each video, and replicate **Step 5** for all of the videos in you project. The second route, and likely the faster and more standardized option, is to replicate the shapes drawn on Video1 in all of the videos of the project, and then move/nudge them to the correct location in each of the videos (if the camera/arena moved slightly across recordings). To replicate the ROI shapes drawn in Video1 to all of the videos in the project, click on the **Apply to all** button next to Video1. Once done, click on **Draw** for Video2. When you click on **Draw** for Video2, a window will pop open with Instructions for how to move shapes - press `Esc` to proceed. When pressing `Esc` the first frame of Video2 will be displayed. Now move the shapes so that they are in the correct locations (as described in Step 6 above), and press `Esc` to save the locations of the shapes.

Repeat this step for all of the videos in the project. Once complete, close the **ROI Table** window, and navigate back to the **ROI** tab in the **Load project** window.

# Part 2. Analyzing ROI data.

1. You can now generate CSV files containing descriptive statistics for the the number entries into each ROI shape, and the time spent within each ROI. SimBA allows you to generate these measures for up-to 2 body-parts (or two animals) in any one video for any one analysis. If you would like to get these measures for more than 2 body-parts, we suggest that you run the analysis multiple times. 

>*Note*: If you at any point want to look at, or modify, the defined ROI shapes for each of the videos, click on the `Load defined ROI table` button in the **ROI** tab under the `Load project` menu. 

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Load_ROI_table.JPG)

Likewise, if you'd like to delete all the shapes you have drawn for all of the videos and start fresh with new shapes, go back to Part 1, Step 3.

2. To analyze your ROI data, click on `Analyze ROI data` in the Analyze ROI submenu. The following menu will pop open:

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_analyze1.jpg)

Here, begin by selecting the number of animals (or body-parts) you wish produce the ROI descriptive statistics for, and then click confirm. A second submenu will appear below named `Choose bodyparts`. This menu will contain as many dropdown menus as the number of animals (or body-parts) selected in the  `Select number of animals` menu. Each of these drop-down menus will contain the body-parts used to track the animals. Select the body-parts you wish to use to calculate the ROI entry and time data, and click run. 

Once complete, a statement will be printed in the main SimBA terminal window noting that the process is complete. The ROI descriptive statistics can be found in the `Project_folder/logs` directory. One file will be named `ROI_entry_data.csv` and contain the netry data. A second file, named `ROI_time_data.csv`, contains the time spent in the different ROIs. 

# Part 3. Generating features from ROI data. 

1. With the ROI information, we can generate several further features that might be useful for predicting behaviors, or be useful within other third-party applications. For each frame of the video, the following features are added to the previously calculated battery of features:

* Boolean (TRUE or FALSE) value noting if the user-selected bodypart is located within or outside each of the ROIs
* Calculate the metric distance between the animal body-part and the center of each ROIs
* The cumulative time spent in each of the ROIs
* The cumulative percentage of the total session time spent in each of the ROIs

If the users are using the the [recommended body parts](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_DLC.md#pose-estimation-body-part-labelling) (including nose, left ear, and right ear), SimBA will also calculate if the animal is directing towards each of the ROIs:

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Directionality_ROI.PNG" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_directionality.gif" width="425"/>

Using these directionality measure, we can calculate several further potentially informative features for each frame for the machine learning model:

* Boolean (TRUE or FALSE) value noting if the animal is directing towards the center each of the ROIs
* The cumulative time spent directing towards each of the ROIs 
* The cumulative percentage of the total session time spent directing towards each of the ROIs

2. To generate these features and add them to the battery of features already calculated, click on `Append ROI data to features` in the `Analyze ROI` submenu of the **ROI** tab. The following menu will pop open:

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_append.JPG)

This menu is very similar to the Analyzing ROI data submenu described in [Part 2 - Step 2](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-2-analyzing-roi-data) described above. First, begin by selecting the number of animals (or body-parts) you wish to use to calculate the ROI features for and then click `Confirm`. A second sub-menu will appear below, named `Choose bodyparts`. This menu will contain as many dropdown menus as the number of animals (or body-parts) selected in the  `Select number of animals` menu. Each of these drop-down menus will contain the body-parts used to track the animals. The body-part(s) choosen in this menu will determine which body-parts is used to calculate the features. For example, if you select the `Nose` body-part, the cumulative time spent in each of the ROIs, as well as all other features, will be calculated based on the `Nose` body-part. Once you have chosen your body-parts, click on `Run`. 

3. Once complete, a statement will be printed in the main SimBA terminal window noting that the process is complete. New CSV files will be generated for each of the videos in the project, located in the `project_foldercsv/features_extracted` folder. If you open these files (watch out, they might be fairly large and therefore difficult to navigate manually) you will see several new columns at the end of the CSV, that contain the ROI-based features. To proceed and generate machine learning classifiers that use these features, continue to the [Label behavior](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#step-6-label-behavior) step, followed by the [Train machine models](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#step-7-train-machine-model) step. 

# Part 4. Visualizing ROI data

You can now generate visualizations of the ROI data for each of the videos in your project. To generate the visualizations, click on `Visualize ROI tracking` in the `Visualize ROI` submenu of the **ROI** tab. This will generate visualizations of the ROI and tracking data, like in these gifs:

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_visualization_1.gif" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_visualization_2.gif" width="425"/>

Clicking on `Visualize ROI tracking` will generate visualizations for all of the files located in the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` folder. The process will generate one frame for each of the frame in the video. For example, if you are generating visualizations for Video1, then the output frames will be located in the `project_folder/frames/output/ROI_analysis/Video1` subfolder.
