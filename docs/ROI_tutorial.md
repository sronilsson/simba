4. Enter the name for the shapes. You can set a fixed width and height for your rectangle in the given entry boxes. If it was left to be 0, rectangle can be drawn by free hand. This is the same case for circle.

5. Once all the information is filled, click on `Set Shape Definitions`, and the **ROI Table** will pop up.

## Step 2: Draw Shape

1. The **ROI Table** will be populated based on the number of videos in your project folder.

2. In this case, I have one video in my project folder and the **ROI Table** will look like this.

4. If you want to apply the ROI to all the video in your project, click `Apply to all` from the same row of the video that you just clicked `Draw`.
