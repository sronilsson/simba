# How to use tools to process videos in SimBA

We have developed video and image processing tools and incorporated them into the overall SimBA pipeline. However, many of the tools are useful on their own or in "one-off" situations. To make these easily accessible, the tools have been incorporated into their own space within the GUI, and are described below.

## Shorten Videos
This is a tool used to trim video lengths. The tool contains two different methods: 
**Method 1** and **Method 2**. 

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/shortenvideos.PNG" width="330" height="287" />

### Method 1 
Use Method 1 to trim both the beginning and the end of the video. 

Let's say we have a 2 minute long video and we want to get rid of the first 10 seconds, and the last 5 seconds.
We would start our video on at `00:00:10`, and end the video at `00:01:55`.

1. First, click on `Browse File` to select the video to trim.

2. Enter the start time in the `Start at:` entry box, in this case it will be *00:00:10*

3. Enter the end time in `End at:` entry box, in this case it will be *00:01:55*. The settings should look like the image below.

4. Click `Cut Video` to trim the video and a new shorter video will be generated. The new shorter video will have a name of *Name of original video* + *_shorten* and will be located in the same folder as the original video.

![alt-text-1](/images/shortenvideos2.PNG "shortenvideos2")


### Method 2
Method 2 cuts of the beginning of the video. 

Let's say we have a 2 minute long video and we want to get rid of the first 20 seconds from the start of the video.

1. Enter the amount of time that needs to be trimmed from the start of the video in `Seconds:`, in this case it will be *20*

![alt-text-1](/images/shortenvideos3.PNG "shortenvideos3")

2. Click `Cut Video` to trim video and a new shorten video will be generated, the new video will have a name of *Name of original video* + *_shorten* and will be located in the same folder as the original video.

## Crop Video
This is a tool to crop videos.

## Multi-crop videos

This is a tool to used to multi-crop videos. For example, if you recorded four different environments with a single camera, you can use this tool to split single recordings into 4 different videos. This tool multi-crops all videos in a folder that is defined by the user. 

1. First, click on Multi-crop and the following menu will pop-open:

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Multi_crop_1.JPG "Multi_crop_1")

2. Next to *Video Folder*, click on `Browse Folder` and select a folder containing the videos you which to multi-crop. 

3. Next to *Output folder*, click on `Browse Folder` and select a folder that should house the cropped output videos. 

4. Next to *Video type*, type the file format of yout input videos (e.g., mp4, avi etc). 

5. Next to *# of crop*, type in the number of cropped videos you wich to generate from each single input video (e.g., 4). Click on **Crop** to proceed. When you click on **Crop**, the first frame of the first video in the specified folder will be displayed, and the name of the video and rectangle number is printed overlaid: 

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Multi_crop.gif "Multi_crop_1")

6. Left click the mouse and drag from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the first video you wish to generate. When finished with the first video, press `Enter`. Repeat this step for the next videos you wish to generate from Video 1. Once Video1 is complete, repeat these steps for all the videos in the user-specified *Video Folder*.

6. The cropped output videos will be located in the user-defined *Output folder* defined in Step 3. 


## Downsample video
This is a tool to downsample a video into smaller size and reduce the resolution of the video.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/downsamplevid.PNG" width="400" height="300" />

The downsample video tool has two options: **Customize Resolution** and **Default Resolution**.

3. Click on `Downsample to default resolution` and the video will downsample into the selected resolution. The video will be located in the same folder as the original video.


## Get Coordinates (calibrate distance)
This tool is to get the length (millimeter) per pixel of a video.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoordtool.PNG" width="300" height="200" />

Let's say we want to find out the metric length per pixel of a video of a mouse in a cage, and we know the width of cage is 130 millimeters (it's a tight one).

1. First, click on `Browse File` to select a video.

2. Enter *130* in the `Known length in real life(mm)` entry box.

3. Click on `Get Distance`, and the following window will pop up.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoordtool2.PNG" width="500" height="500" />

>*Note*: When the frame is displayed, it may not be shown at the correct aspect ratio. To fix this, drag the window corner to the correct aspect ratio. 

4. Use your mouse to double *Left click* at the left side of the cage and double *Left click* again on the right side of the cage. These are the known distance of 130 mm.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoordtool3.PNG" width="500" height="500" />

>**Note:** You can double click any point again to change the location of the point.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoord.gif" width="500" height="500" />

### Extract frames
Use this tool to extract every frame from a single video.

1. Click on `Browse File` to select a video file. 

2. Click on `Extract all frames` to extract every frame from the video.

3. A folder with the video name will be generated and the all the extracted frames will be located in the folder. The frames will be in *.png* file format. 

### Extract frames from seq files
Use this tool to extract all the frames from a video in **seq** file format.

1. Click on `Browse File` to select a video.

2. Click on `Extract All Frames` to extract all the frames from the video.
