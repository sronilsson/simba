# Using SimBA to create/edit [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) tracking models. 

**!!! ATTENTION !!!**

**IF YOU ALREADY HAVE GENERATED A DLC TRACKING MODEL AND CREATED .CSV DATAFRAMES FOR YOUR EXPERIMENTAL VIDEOS (USING THE ANNOTATION CONFIGURATION DETAILED IN THE FIGURE BELOW), PLEASE SKIP THIS ENTIRE PAGE AND MOVE ON TO STEP 3: BUILDING CLASSIFIERS**

**!!! ATTENTION !!!**

See **"Pose estimation body-part labelling"** below for supported rodent annotation formats. You **must use** one of these formats if you would like to use our included feature list for creating predictive classifiers. We **strongly** suggest using 8 body parts per rodent. 

**Again, if you have generated your DLC tracking using another body part labelling configuration, it will not work "right out of the box"!**

**NOTE:** Some versions of DeepLabCut saves data in *hdf5* format by default. For information on how to output DeepLabCut data in csv file format, [go to the DeepLabcut repository](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/deeplabcut/pose_estimation_tensorflow/predict_videos.py).

DeepLabCut is currently fully supported by the SimBA pipeline. We **strongly** suggest that users generate their DLC tracking model using the DLC GUI. This will provide the most up-to-date and pleasurable annotation experience, followed by loading the generated DLC tracking data and raw videos into SimBA. Future iterations will include tracking support for mask R-CNN, LEAP, DeepPoseKit, etc, as requested by the community.

**IF YOU STILL WOULD LIKE TO GENERATE YOUR DLC TRACKING MODEL AND .CSV DATAFRAMES VIA SIMBA, CONTINUE...**

**NOTE:** This section of SimBA was written early on - when [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) was accessed exclusively by the command line and did not come with the excellent graphical user interface it comes with today. At that early point we added DeepLabCut commands to SimBA to make many of the important DeepLabCut functions accessible for all members of the lab, regardless of previous programming experience. We have left these features in the current build, as an option for use.

## Pose estimation body-part labelling

![alt-text-1](/images/body_part_labelling_schematic.jpg "Body_part_labelling_schematic.jpg")

SimBA uses the tracking data to construct a battery of *features* (for a list of features with example descriptions, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Feature_description.csv)). The number of labelled body parts, and which body parts are labelled and tracked, determines which features can be calculated. 

We have validated SimBA by labelling 16 body parts (8 body parts on two individual mice) and we **strongly** advice users to use the same body part labelling schematic. 

Please note that the **order** of body part annotation is important, and matches the labelling schematic above.

If using SimBA, set the DeepLabCut config to use the 16 body part schematic by checking the `Apply Golden Aggression Config` box (See **Step 1**, below). Pre-trained DLC tracking models using the 16 body part schematic and two animals can also be downloaded through [OSF](https://osf.io/5t4y9/), covering a range of acquisition parameters (color video, blank and white video, etc).

However, SimBA will also accept alternative body labelling schematics (see the above figure). These alternative schematics currently include:

   * 7 body parts on two individual mice recorded 90° above angle
   * 4 body parts on two individual mice recorded 90° above angle   
   * 8 body parts on a single mouse recorded 90° above angle
   * 7 body parts on a single mouse recorded 90° above angle
   * 4 body parts on a single mouse recorded 90° above angle
   * 9 body parts on a single mouse recorded 45° side angle
   
**Important**: So far we have only validated machine learning models that use features calculated from 16 labelled body parts on two individual animals. The other configurations are "use at your own risk" and may require trouble-shooting.

> *Note* : SimBA now also supports user-created body-part annotation schemes. These annotations schemes can be created in the SimBA project configuration menu - click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Pose_config.md) to learn more.


## SimBA-DLC Pipeline breakdown
For detailed information on the DeepLabCut workflow, see the [DeepLabCut repository](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut). 

The SimBA-DLC pipeline is confirmed compatible with DLC v2.0.9.

**Note**: All videos should have been pre-processed, see [Step 1: Video pre-processing](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial_process_videos.md), prior to DLC tracking.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/createdlcmodel.png" width="400" height="200" />

### Step 1: Generate a new DLC model. 
This step generates a new DeepLabCut project.

1. In the main SimBA window, click on `Tracking` --> `DeepLabCut` --> `Create DLC Model`. The following window will pop up.

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/DLC_menu2.PNG "createdlcmodel2")

2. Enter the name of your project in the `Project name` entry box.

3. Enter the name of the experimenter in the `Experimenter name` entry box.

> **Note:** Spaces are not allowed in the project name or the experimenter name.

4. Next, import the videos into your project. If you are adding only one video, you can click on <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/importsinglevideo.PNG" width="120" height="27" /> and the <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/videofolder.PNG" width="274" height="27" /> in **green** should change to <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/videopath.PNG" width="274" height="27" /> **blue**. Next, click on `Browse File` to select a video file.

5. To import multiple videos into your project, click on <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/importmultivideo.PNG" width="120" height="27" /> and the **green** <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/videofolder.PNG" width="274" height="27" /> will appear. Click on `Browse Folder` and choose a folder containing the videos to import into your project. 

>**Note:** The default settings is to **import multiple videos**.

6. Next, select the main directory that your project will be located in. Next to `Project directory`, click on `Browse Folder` and choose a directory.

7. If you wish to use the settings used by the Golden lab (this setting is used to track two mice, and eight body parts on each of the two mice) check the `Apply Golden Aggression Config' box. For more information, see above section and figure. If you wish to generate your own DeepLabCut tracking config, using a different annotation configuration, please leave this box un-ticked.

8. You can either copy all the videos to your DeepLabCut project folder, or create shortcuts to the videos. By checking the `Copy Videos` checkbox, the videos will be copied to your project folder. If this box is left un-ticked, shortcuts to your videos will be created. This can be useful if you wish to save storage space, or if you have very large or numerous video files.

9. Click on `Create Project` to create your DeepLabCut project. The project will be located in the chosen **working directory**.

10. You will need to Load this project to use it. Move to Part 2 below.

## Part 2: Load DLC Project
These menus are used to load created DeepLabCut projects.

![alt-text-1](/images/loaddlcmodel.png "loaddlcmodel")

### Step 1: Check the settings in the DeepLabCut config.yaml file

1. Go to the project folder.

2. Double click on the config.yaml file and open it in a text editor like Notepad.

3. Change the settings if necessary. 

### Step 2: Load the DeepLabCut config.yaml file

2. Under the **Load Model** tab, click on `Browse File` and load the *config.yaml* file from your project folder.

### Step 3: Add additional videos to the project (optional)

This step can be useful if you would like to add new videos to refine your tracking model that were not avilable previously.

![alt-text-1](/images/additionalvideo.PNG "additionalvideo")

#### Single Video

1. Under the **Add videos into project** tab and **Single Video** heading, click on `Browse File` and select the video you wish to add to the project.

2. Click on `Add single video`.

#### Multiple Videos

1. Under the **Add videos into project** tab and **Multiple Videos** heading, click on `Browse Folder` and select the folder containing the videos you wish to add to the project.

2. Click on `Add multiple videos`.

### Step 4: Extract frames for labeling body parts using DLC. For more details, see the [DeepLabcut repository](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#c-data-selection-extract-frames)

![alt-text-1](/images/extractframesdlc.PNG "extractframesdlc")

1. Under the **Extract/label frames tab** tab and **Extract Frames DLC** heading, enter the number of frames you wish to extract from the videos in the `numframes2pick` entry box.

2. Select the **Mode** of extracting the frames. 

- `Automatic` selects the frames to extract automatically. 

- `Manual` allows you to select the frames to extract.

3. Select the **Algorithm** used to pick the frames to extract. 

- `Uniform` selects the frames uniformly in a series format. 

- `KMeans` uses k-means clustering algorithm to select the frames randomly based on cluster. 

- `Cluster Resize Width` is the setting for KMeans. The default is set to 30.

- `Cluster Step` is the setting for KMeans. The default is set to 1.

4. To use color information for clustering, check the `True` box next to **Cluster Color**.

5. If you wish to use **OpenCV** to extract frames, check the `True` box. If you wish to use **ffmpeg**, keep this box un-checked.

6. Click on `Extract Frames` to begin to extract the frames.

### Step 5: Label Frames

![alt-text-1](/images/labelframes.PNG "labelframes")

1. Under **Label Frames** heading in the **Extract/label frames tab** tab, click on `Label Frames` and the *DeepLabCut- Labelling ToolBox* will pop up.

2. Click on `Load Frames` located in the bottom left-hand corner.

3. Navigate to the folder with the video name where your extracted frames are saved, and click `Select Folder`. *They should be located at workingdirectory/yourproject/labeled-data/*

4. Now you can start labelling frames. For more details, see the [DeepLabCut repository](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/functionDetails.md#d-label-frames).

5. Once all the frames are labelled, move on to **Step 6**.

### Step 6: Check Labels 

1. Under **Check Labels**, click on `Check Labelled Frames` to check the labelled frames.

### Step 7: Generate training set

1. Under **Generate Training Set**, click on the `Generate training set` button to generate a new training set.

### Step 8: Train Network
Train the model using a training set. Note that there are two scenarios:

1. **Training from scratch**: In the `iteration` entry box, fill in an integer (e.g., 0) representing the model iteration number. Once done, click on **Update iteration**.  If left blank, then the iteration number will be the most recently used. If the iteration number isn't specified, and you are working with a new project, it will default to 0. 

2. **Training from previous weights**: In the `init_weight` box, specify the path to the initial weights. If this is left blank it will default to resnet-50. If you want to use other weights, click on `Browse File`. 

Pre-trained weights for mouse and rat resident-intruder protocols using 16 body-parts, as well as other pre-trained weights, can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/5t4y9/). Downloaded weights may consist of three files (*.index, .meta, .data*). In the `init_weight` box, specify the path to any of the three downloaded files. 

### Step 9: Evaluate Network

1. Click on `Evaluate Network` to evaluate the trained model. For more details, see the [DeepLabCut repository](https://alexemg.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/functionDetails.html#h-evaluate-the-trained-network).

### Step 10: Video Analysis

#### Single Video Analysis

1. Under the **Video Analysis** tab and the **Single Video Analysis** header, click on `Browse File` and select one video file.

2. Click on `Single Video Analysis`.

#### Multiple Videos Analysis

1. Under the **Video Analysis** tab and the **Multiple Videos Analysis** header, click on `Browse Folder` and select a folder containing the videos you wish to analyze.

2. Enter the video format in the `Video type` entry box (eg: mp4, avi). *Do **not** include any " . " dot in the entry box (e.g,: for example, do not enter .mp4, .flv, or .avi. Instead enter mp4, flv, or avi*). 

3. Click on `Multi Videos Analysis`.

### Step 11: Plot Video Graph

1. Click on `Browse File` to select the video.

2. Click on `Plot Results`. For more details, see the [DeepLabCut documentation](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/UseOverviewGuide.md).

### Step 12: Create Video
This step will generate a video with labelled tracking points.

1. Click on `Browse File` to select the video.

2. You can choose to save the frames with tracking points on the video, and not just the compressed video file, by checking the `Save Frames` box. This process takes longer if you want to render to whole video. However, if you just want to check on a few frames how the model is doing, you can render a few images and terminate the process and save time. 

3. Click on `Create Video`.

## Part 3: Improve the Model
There are two ways that you can improve DeepLabCut generated tracking models.

1. Extract more frames to train the model.

2. Correct the predictions made by the model on new frames.

## Extract more frames
This step automates the **Extract Frames** process to only extract frames from select videos. This function will copy the settings from the DeepLabCut *config.yaml* and remove all the videos in the *config.yaml* file. The function will then add the new videos that the user specifies into a new, temporary yaml file, and extract frames from only the videos included in the temporary yaml file. 

### Step 1: Generate temp.yaml from the original config.yaml

#### Single Video

1. Under **Load Model**, click `Browse File` and select the *config.yaml* file. 

2. Under `[Generate temp yaml]` tab --> `Single video`, click on `Browse File` and select the video.

3. Click on `Add single video`

4. A *temp.yaml* file will be generated in the same folder as the project folder.

#### Multiple Videos

1. Under **Load Model**, click `Browse File` and select the *config.yaml* file. 

2. Under `[Generate temp yaml]` tab --> `Multiple videos`, click on `Browse Folder` and select the folder containing *only* the videos you want to add to your peoject and extract additional frames from.

3. Click on `Add multiple videos`.

4. A *temp.yaml* file will be generated in the same folder as the project folder.

### Step 2: Load temp.yaml 

1. Under **Load Model**, click `Browse File` and select the *temp.yaml* that you have just created.

2. Now you can extract frames of the videos that you have just added. Return to **Part 1, Step 4** to update the model with the new frames.

## Tracking Point Correction

### Step 1: Load config.yaml

1. Go to `Tracking` --> `DeepLabCut` --> `Load DLC Model`.

2. Under **Load Model**, click on `Browse File` and load the *config.yaml* file from the project folder.

### Step 2: Extract Outliers

1. Under **Extract Outliers**, click `Browse File` to select the videos to you want to extract outlier frames from. 

2. Click on `Extract Outliers`.

### Step 3: Label Outliers

1. Under **Label Outliers**, click on `Refine Outliers`. The *DeepLabCut - Refinement ToolBox* will pop open.

2. In the bottom left-hand corner, click on `Load labels` and select the *machinelabels* file to start to correct the tracking points. For more information on how to correct outliers in DeepLabCut, go to the [DeepLabCut repository](https://alexemg.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/functionDetails.html#j-refinement-extract-outlier-frames).

### Step 4: Merge Labelled Outliers

1. Under **Merge Labeled Outliers**, click on `Merge Labelled Outliers` to add the labelled outlier frames to your dataset.
