# User-defined pose-configurations in SimBA

We strongly recommend using SimBA with a [16-body-part, 2 animal, pose-configuration setting](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_DLC.md#pose-estimation-body-part-labelling). Besides this body-part configuration, SimBa also comes with several other other pre-generated pose-configuration settings which can be selected in the [Create Project](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-1-generate-project-config) menu.

Furthermore, users can also define their own pose-configuration settings and use any number of body-part configuration in SimBA. **CAUTION**: When users create projects with user-defined body part configurations, SimBA calculates fewer features for the machine models and this may negatively affect the prediction performance. Thus, if users **can** use the suggested [16-body-part, 2 animal, pose-configuration setting](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_DLC.md#pose-estimation-body-part-labelling) we recommend doing so. Click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/features_user_defined_pose_config.csv) for a list of the features that SimBA calculates based on user-defined pose configurations.  

# Create a new user-defined pose-configuration

1. In the main SimBA console window, click on `File` and on `Create a new project`. The window that pops open is descibed in-depth the [Scenario 1 - Create Project](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-1-generate-project-config) tutorial. When you are creating a new user-defined pose-configuration setting, **do not** specify a project path, project name, or any SML settings. Instead, skip these menus and click on the button in the `Animal Settings` menu next to the text `# config`. You should see the following default menu:

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Create_pose_config_1.png "Pose config menu 1")

Click on `Create pose config` to begin to define a new user-defined pose configuration. 

2.  After clicking on `Create pose config`, the following menu pops open:

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Pose_config_2.PNG "Pose config menu 2")

In the *first* entry box, give your pose-configuration a name. This could be, for example, BtWGaNP_pose: **avoid spaces in the pose config name**. In the *second* entry box, enter the number of animals you wish to track. This could be 1 or 2. In the *third* entry box, enter the number of body-parts the dataset contains. For example, if the dataset contains 8 tracked body-parts on two different animals, I enter the integer 16. 

Next, select an image that is representative of your tracking environment and contains a clear view of all the tracked bodyparts by clicking on `Browse File`. This image will be used to create a reference image of your pose configuration settings. After you have selected an image, click on `Confirm`.

3. After clicking confirm the following table should pop open:

![alt-text-1](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Pose_config_image_3.PNG "Pose config menu 3")

The table contains one row for each body-part specified in the `# of Bodyparts` entry box. Please name the bodyparts by filling in their names. **Do not use spaces in the bodypart names**.

**IMPORTANT** If you have two animals, you might want to track two body-parts with the same name for each of the animals: for example the *Nose* of the two animals. If this is the case, then name the two noses *Nose_1* for animal 1, and *Nose_2* for animal 2.  Click on `Save Pose Configs` to proceed. 

3. After clicking on `Save Pose Configs`, a window named `Define pose` pops open that shows the frame chosen in Image Path, with some instructions at the top, like the image below left). Follow the instructions at the top of the window to label all of your defined body parts, like the gif below on the right:

The window will close once all the body-parts have been marked. 

4. Your newly created body part configuration should now be accessable though the `Animal Settings` menu next to the text `# config`:

5. If you would like to use your newly created pose-configuration setting in a new DeepLabCut project.
