# SimBA or SimBAxDLC?
**!!! IMPORTANT !!!**
You can choose to install SimBA as a standalone package or install SimBA with DeepLabCut integration.  

1) If you would like to be able to call DeepLabCut commands via the SimBA interface, and either have already installed DeepLabCut or would like to now install DeepLabCut on your local machine (requires a GPU), please install SimBAxDLC from the **master** branch.  Please see full instructions below.

2) If you do not want to use DeepLabCut on your local machine, and instead use Google Colab or have DeepLabCut installed elsewhere, please install SimBA from the **SimBA_no_DLC** branch. This does not require a GPU. Please see full instructions below.
